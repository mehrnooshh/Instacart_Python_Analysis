Using Python for Instacart Basket Analysis. Instacart is a real company that’s made their data available online. However, the contents of this project have been fabricated for the purpose of learning.

# Objective

through an app in North America. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more

segmentation based on the provided criteria.
